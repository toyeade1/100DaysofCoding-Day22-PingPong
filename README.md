# 100DaysofCoding-Day22-PingPong


for this challenge I created a ping pong game that allows 2 players to control the direction of the ball and keep score. I also added a caviat in preperation for adding all of my games into one mini game. If the any user scores more that 10 points then the game exits, instead of staying indefinetly.
